# Magnetic-Cave-Game
Implement a project using Jave programming language, which is a 2-player adversary game where each player tries to build a “bridge” of 5 magnetic bricks within a cave whose left and right walls are magnetic, where we represented the bricks of one of the players with ■ and the bricks of the other with □ through three modes
1.	manual entry for both ■'s moves and □'s moves
2.	manual entry for ■'s moves & automatic moves for □
3.	manual entry for □'s moves & automatic moves for ■
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The rules of the game that we applied are:
•	At first, the cave (the blackboard) is empty.
•	Player ■ (the first player) and player □ (the second player) move in an alternate manner, if we start with ■. Followed by □, then ■ again, then □ again..., until the end with either a win or a tie (the board is full).
•	Given that there are two large magnets on each side of the cave, the player can only place a brick on an empty place of the cave, provided that the bricks are stacked directly on the left or right wall, or stacked to the left or right of another brick (of any color).
•	Once one player can line up 5 consecutive bricks in a row, in a column, or on a diagonal, that player wins the game.
•	If no player can achieve a winning combination and the board is full, the game stops and there is a tie. As we mentioned at the beginning.
